# FliBooking - Flight Booking Web Application

## üß© Tech Stack & Framework Justification

### üîß Frontend: React + Parcel + Tailwind CSS

- **React (v19)**  
  React is known for its faster dom manipulation. React's hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useNavigate`) allow us to manage state and side effects cleanly across the app. It's highly maintainable and widely adopted in the industry.

- **Parcel**  
  A zero-config bundler that is simpler and faster than Webpack for small to medium-sized projects. It supports modern JavaScript out-of-the-box with minimal boilerplate.

- **Tailwind CSS**  
  Utility-first CSS framework that allows rapid UI development without switching between HTML and CSS files. It ensures consistent styling with minimal custom CSS, and excellent responsiveness via utility classes.

### üõ†Ô∏è Backend: Node.js + Express

- **Express.js**  
  Lightweight and flexible Node.js framework suitable for building RESTful APIs. Express is mature, well-documented, and integrates smoothly with middlewares like `express-validator` for validation and `cors` for cross-origin support.

- **Validation using `express-validator`**  
  Ensures backend robustness by validating user input (e.g., required fields, email format, ID structure) before processing. This complements frontend validation and improves security.

---

### üì¶ API Design

- RESTful API routes are implemented using Express routers (`/api/flights`, `/api/bookings`)
- Frontend communicates with backend via `axios` with proper `try/catch` and feedback mechanisms
- Pagination and sorting are supported server-side
- Bookings are created with validated input, and a unique Booking ID is returned
- Data is mocked/stored in memory for the prototype stage

---

### üéØ Design Principles

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: React components are cleanly divided into reusable parts (e.g., `FlightCard`, `FlightList`, `BookingForm`)
- **User Experience**:
  - Form validations on both frontend and backend
  - Immediate feedback on booking confirmation with redirect
  - Consistent design with Tailwind CSS utility classes
- **Responsive Design**: All pages and form elements adapt well to mobile and desktop views using Tailwind grid and flex utilities
